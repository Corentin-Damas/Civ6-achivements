# The Challenge

### why
Mix different abilities to retrieve information from the web (webscraping), api and cross check the information for better organisation.

I wanted to create a fun little challenge to help me get the most from a game, Civilisation 6, a get most of the achivement that we can get in the game.
The idea come from the fact that Steam, the distribution platform of the game have registered 306 different achivement that we can get by playing the 60+ different civilisation and game mode from the game.
However it's not really possible to organise the one that we already have, witch Civilisation have already done all there possible achivement and so on. 

- Luckly we can get from the Steam API the datas of our achivement
- It exist a website that list all achivement per Cvilization we can get 

By crossing this two data we can possibly have a better picture of what we can do to get the most of the game in a shorter time.


## The game
"Civilization VI is a turn-based strategy video game in which one or more players compete alongside computer-controlled AI opponents to grow their individual civilization from a small tribe to control of the entire planet across several periods of development. "
